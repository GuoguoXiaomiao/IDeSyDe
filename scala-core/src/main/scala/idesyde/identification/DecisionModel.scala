/** The trait/interface for a decision model in the design space identification methodology, as
  * defined in [1].
  *
  * A decision model holds information on how to build a design space that is explorable. In other
  * words, an object that implements this trait is assumed to provide parameters, and/or decision
  * variables, and/or analysis techniques for a certain design model.
