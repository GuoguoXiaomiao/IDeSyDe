/** The trait/interface for a decision model in the design space identification methodology, as
  * defined in [1].
  *
  * A decision model holds information on how to build a design space that is explorable. In other
  * words, an object that implements this trait is assumed to provide decision variables and/or
  * analysis for a certain design model.
  *
  * In order to make this class 100% sensible from a Java and OOP perspective, the dominance method
  * takes the base model as an input, instead of it being a type inside the trait. This does not
  * change much from the conceptual perspective, as the extensions of this trait can simply
  * implemented a coverage-based dominance criterium, as originally proposed in [1].
